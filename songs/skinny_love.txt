[Intro]

Am   C
Am   C
Am   C
G    Am


[Verse]

Am              C
Come on skinny love just last the year
Am             C
Pour a little salt we were never here
        Am          C
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
               G                          Am
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

Am        C
I tell my love to wreck it all
Am              C
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
        Am          C
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
             G                    Am
Right in the moment this order's tall


[Chorus]

  C
I told you to be patient
  G             F
I told you to be fine
  C
I told you to be balanced
  G            F
I told you to be kind
       C
In the morning I'll be with you
            G            F
But it will be a different "kind"
        C
I'll be holding all the tickets
              G            F
And you'll be owning all the fines


[Verse]

Am              C
Come on skinny love what happened here
Am            C
Suckle on the hope in lite brassiere
        Am          C
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
               G                     Am
Sullen load is full; so slow on the split


[Chorus]

  C
I told you to be patient
  G           F
I told you to be fine
  C
I told you to be balanced
  CG            F
I told you to be kind
       C
Now all your love is wasted?
            G             F
Then who the hell was I?
        C
Now I'm breaking at the bridges
              G            F
And at the end of all your lines



[Outro]

C
Who will love you?
G         F
Who will fight?
C             G       F
Who will fall far behind?


[Coda]

Am   C
Am   C
Am   C
G    Am
